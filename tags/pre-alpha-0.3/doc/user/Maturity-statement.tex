The latest release of the EXIP library is pre-alpha version 0.3. As such, 
many features are missing and others are not stable enough for real-world
usage. Here is the status of the EXIP functionality:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Currently only ASCII strings are supported. It should be relatively easy to extend
that with Unicode strings by implementing a dozen of functions in the header
file \texttt{stringManipulate.h}
 \item EXIP is working quite stable when using the default options in the EXI header in schema-less mode
 \item Schema-enabled mode is unstable and has limited features supported. The reason is in the
status of the grammar generation utility that converts XML Schema definitions to EXIP grammars.
For example, the import of external schema definitions through \texttt{xsd:import} is currently not supported.
 \item The following EXI header options are supported: EXI Cookie, Options Presence Bit, Strict, Fragment,
Preserve.prefixes, SchemaId, ValueMaxLength and ValuePartitionCapacity.
\end{itemize}
