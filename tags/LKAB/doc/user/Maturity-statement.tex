The latest release of the EXIP library is alpha version 0.4. As such, 
some features are missing and others are not stable enough for real-world
usage. Here is the status of the EXIP functionality:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Currently only ASCII strings are supported. It should be relatively easy to extend
this with Unicode strings by implementing a dozen of functions in the header
file \texttt{stringManipulate.h}
 \item Using default options in the EXI header and schema-less mode should work without any issues
 \item Schema-enabled processing can cause problems with some XML schema constructs. The reason is in the
grammar generation utility that converts XML Schema definitions to EXIP grammars. It still does not cover
all the features of the XML Schema specification such as string pattern facets, unions and lists.
 \item The following EXI header options are not supported yet: byte-alignment, pre-compression,
compression, preserving lexical values, random access (selfContained), datatype representation map.
\end{itemize}
