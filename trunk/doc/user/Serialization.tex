\section{Serialization}

This section describes the process of serializing an EXI stream using the EXIP API.
The description is divided into two parts - schema-less and schema-enabled encoding.
The basic steps are essentially the same in both cases so the schema-enabled one is only
discussing some special use-cases and configurations that differ from the schema-less
serialization. 

As discussed in section \ref{sec:Basic-Concepts}, the EXIP API is especially useful
for applications that are not dependent on XML APIs and text XML inputs. Example
use cases are embedded devices working exclusively with EXI, XML binding tools
that generate parsing/serialization code from XML Schema definitions, productivity tools
etc. If your application works with text XML input that needs to be converted to EXI
you need to create an external module that is build on top of the EXIP serialization API.
